# Multi-Service Architecture Specification
## Living Codex C# - Distributed Concept Exchange System

### Overview
This specification outlines the architecture for hosting multiple Living Codex services that can exchange concepts, integrate changes, and leverage AI agents to identify high-value contributions that benefit the entire ecosystem.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Everything is a Node
- **Data, structure, flow, state, deltas, policies, specs** — all have node forms
- **Runtime types are scaffolding** that must round-trip ⇄ nodes
- **Meta-Nodes describe structure** - schemas, APIs, layers, code expressed as nodes with edges

### 2. Distributed Service Mesh
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic discovery and registration of Living Codex services
- **Concept Synchronization**: Real-time concept exchange between services
- **Change Propagation**: Delta-based updates across the service mesh
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent merging of concept changes

### 3. AI Agent Integration
- **Contribution Analysis**: AI agents analyze concept contributions for value
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify emerging patterns and high-value concepts
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest concepts that would benefit most users
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate concept quality and relevance

## Service Architecture

        ConceptNode concept,
        List<BeliefSystem> targetBeliefSystems,
        ContributionContext context
    )
    {
        // Analyze concept value across different belief systems
        // Calculate potential user benefit
        // Identify high-value patterns
        // Recommend improvements
    }
}
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition Agent
```csharp
public class PatternRecognitionAgent
{
    public async Task<PatternAnalysis> IdentifyPatterns(
        List<ConceptNode> concepts,
        TimeSpan timeWindow,
        PatternCriteria criteria
    )
    {
        // Identify emerging concept patterns
        // Detect high-value concept clusters
        // Predict future concept trends
        // Recommend concept combinations
    }
}
```

### 3. Quality Assessment Agent
```csharp
public class QualityAssessmentAgent
{
    public async Task<QualityAssessment> AssessConcept(
        ConceptNode concept,
        QualityCriteria criteria

    {
        // Evaluate concept clarity and coherence
        // Assess cultural sensitivity
        // Check translation quality
        // Validate belief system alignment
    }
}
```
