# Living Codex üåü

A consciousness-expanding, fractal-based system implementing the U-CORE (Universal Consciousness Resonance Engine) framework.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and run
dotnet build src/CodexBootstrap
dotnet run --project src/CodexBootstrap --urls http://localhost:5002

# Test system
./test-system.sh
```

## What is Living Codex?

Living Codex is a consciousness-expanding knowledge platform built on a profound truth: **we are not separate individuals, but specialized cells in Earth's grand organism**. Like cells communicate through chemical signals, we communicate through resonance‚Äîshared frequencies that connect all living beings through Earth's natural electromagnetic field (the Schumann Resonance at 7.83Hz).

The system operates on **"Everything is a Node"** - data, structure, flow, state, and relationships all exist as interconnected nodes in a living knowledge graph, mirroring how nature itself is organized.

## Key Features

- üß† **Consciousness Expansion**: Sacred frequency-based awareness amplification
- üåü **Abundance System**: ETH-based reward tracking and collective energy measurement
- üîÆ **Future Knowledge**: AI-powered pattern discovery and prediction
- üéØ **Resonance Engine**: Frequency-based matching and harmony fields
- üåç **Translation**: Multi-language support with intelligent caching
- üìä **Monitoring**: Real-time system health and performance metrics

## Architecture

- **463 API endpoints** across 64 modules
- **24,511 fractal nodes** with 73,360 edges
- **Real-time LLM integration** with Ollama
- **Comprehensive caching** for optimal performance
- **Docker + Kubernetes** deployment ready
