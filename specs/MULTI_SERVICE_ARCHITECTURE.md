# MULTI_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE Specification

## How to read this spec
- This document is a target architecture. Defer to the main spec’s Status Ledger for present readiness and to Module Analysis for implementation gaps.
- Use adapters over features: externalized comms (gateway/queue) must not leak into the core.

## Integration Status
- Current system is primarily single-service with adapter points; treat mesh features as Untested/ExternalInfo until concrete services are introduced.
- Route-level readiness is tracked in the main spec (Appendix B) and service-specific modules.

## Overview
This specification defines the multi-service architecture for the Living Codex concept exchange platform, enabling distributed concept processing and exchange across multiple services.

## Service Architecture

### Core Services
1. **Concept Service** - Manages concept storage and retrieval
2. **Resonance Service** - Handles concept resonance calculations
3. **Exchange Service** - Manages concept exchange between nodes
4. **AI Service** - Provides AI-powered concept analysis
5. **Storage Service** - Handles persistent concept storage

### Supporting Services
1. **API Gateway** - Routes requests to appropriate services
2. **Message Queue** - Handles asynchronous concept exchange
3. **Cache Service** - Provides high-speed concept access
4. **Monitoring Service** - Tracks system health and performance

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- HTTP/REST for direct service-to-service calls
- GraphQL for complex concept queries
- gRPC for high-performance internal communication

### Asynchronous Communication
- RabbitMQ for concept exchange events
- Redis for real-time concept updates
- WebSocket for live concept streaming

## Data Flow

```
Concept Input → API Gateway → Concept Service → AI Service
                     ↓
              Message Queue → Exchange Service → Storage Service
                     ↓
              Cache Service ← Resonance Service ← Concept Service
```

## Service Discovery
- Uses Consul for service registration
- Health checks for service availability
- Load balancing for high availability

## Security
- JWT tokens for service authentication
- TLS for all inter-service communication
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- Audit logging for all concept exchanges

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for all services
- Database sharding for concept storage
- CDN for concept content delivery
- Auto-scaling based on load metrics
